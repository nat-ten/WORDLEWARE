# WORDLEWARE
DON'T RUN THIS IN AN UNPROTECTED ENVIRONMENT

Windows Ransomware where the ransom is a game of Wordle.

Heavily inspired by Rensenware: https://github.com/0x00000FF/rensenware-cut

When WORDLEWARE is run, it will encrypt as many files as it can in the user's directory using AES with a 256 bit key.
