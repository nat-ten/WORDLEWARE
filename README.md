# WORDLEWARE
DON'T RUN THIS IN AN UNPROTECTED ENVIRONMENT. THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT STORE THE KEY, SO IF IT CRASHES OR YOU CLOSE IT PREMATURELY, DATA WILL BE LOST.

Windows Ransomware where the ransom is a game of Wordle.

Targeted extensions include:
".jpg, .txt, .ppt, .zip, .7z, .pdf, .docx, .PNG, .png, .log, .xlsx, .flac, .mp4, .mp3, .c, .gif, .doc, .pptx, .wav, .js, .avi, .cpp, .dat, .raw"

Heavily inspired by Rensenware: https://github.com/0x00000FF/rensenware-cut

When WORDLEWARE is run, it will encrypt as many files as it can in the user's directory using AES 256 Encryption.
